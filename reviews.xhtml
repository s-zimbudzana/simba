                A pair of formal shoes that present a worker as serious about their craft and simply stylish. These shoes unfortunately have laces that end up detracting from their style however one can easily replace them with laces that give these shoes the respect they deserve.

               Lovely oxfords that complete any formal occassion and clothing. Unfortunately, these shoes lack in comfortability and are severely lacking in a originality lending them the title of being a bit of a "basic" pair of boots.
